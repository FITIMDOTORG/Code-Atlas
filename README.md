# Code Atlas  

**Code Atlas** is an innovative tool that provides developers with a **visual map of their codebase**. Using graph theory and AI-driven insights, it generates an interactive visualization of files, classes, and functions, helping you understand, navigate, and optimize complex projects.  

---

## Key Features  
1. **Code Mapping**  
   - Visualize your codebase as an interactive graph.  
   - Nodes represent files, and edges represent dependencies and references.  

2. **AI Insights**  
   - Identify potential issues like high coupling or unused code.  
   - Get suggestions for optimization and refactoring.  

3. **Interactive Visualization**  
   - Click nodes to view file content and related connections.  
   - Highlight paths (e.g., "What depends on this module?").  

4. **Multi-language Support**  
   - Supports Python, JavaScript, Java, and C++ (more to come!).  

5. **Version Control Integration**  
   - View how the codebase evolves over time.  
   - Compare branches visually with Git integration.  

---

## Use Cases  
- **Onboarding**: Help new developers quickly understand the structure of your codebase.  
- **Refactoring**: Identify and improve complex or tightly coupled areas in your project.  
- **Code Reviews**: Visualize the impact of changes directly on the code map.  

---

## How It Works  
1. **Input**: Upload your project or connect to your Git repository.  
2. **Processing**:  
   - Parses the codebase to identify dependencies and structure.  
   - AI analyzes the code for potential improvements.  
3. **Output**:  
   - A dynamic, interactive graph with actionable insights.

## Roadmap  
Here's what we're working on and planning for the future:  

- [x] **Basic Features**: Initial parsing and visualization of Python and JavaScript.  
- [x] **Graph Visualization**: Interactive map with nodes and edges for dependencies.  
- [ ] **Language Support**: Add support for Java, C++, and additional frameworks.  
- [ ] **AI Integration**: Use machine learning to suggest code improvements and optimizations.  
- [ ] **Version Control**: Visualize branch differences and changes over time with Git integration.  
- [ ] **Plugin Support**: Allow third-party developers to extend Code Atlas with custom functionality.
